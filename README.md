# Mantaflow VR #

VR version of Mantaflow, using OpenVR

#### Controls ####
* Arrow_Up: Increase scale
* Arrow_Down: Decrease scale
* Arrow_Right: Rotate right
* Arrow_Left: Rotate left
* Keypad_8: Change plane

For now these are the only controls that have been ported over from the original project, hopefully in the future I can enable more of the original functionality
